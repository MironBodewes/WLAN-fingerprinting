Just start the main.py.

## make some fingerprints by typing:
f       
<number_of_rooms>   
<locationname_1>     
<locationname_2>    
 ...    
<locationname_n>

### Example1:
The Program will then ask for your first command:   
`f` or `fingerprint`  
`2`   
`room1`  
`room2`     

The Program will then ask for your next command:

`l` or `locate`
The Program will then try to tell you which room you are closest to and await your next command.    
`x` to exit
